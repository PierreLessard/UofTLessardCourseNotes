# Collection of my TeX notes for University of Toronto Courses

 
These notes are only for courses where I found that the course content was based on definitions and concepts, yet there was not one place to access all definitions.
The trend is these courses are mainly slide based and there is no official course notes provided.
The textbooks for these courses are usually way too long (needle in haystack scenario), not all ecompassing, differs from what the proffesor prefers or a mess.
The current final version of each set of notes is in the Completed Notes directoy. 

I write my notes using the VScode LaTeX workshop extension. I use the styling and preamble from https://github.com/SeniorMars/dotfiles/tree/master/latex_template
